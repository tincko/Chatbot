This is a test document for RAG.
It contains information about the patient's medication adherence.
The patient often forgets to take their medication when they are busy at work.
They find it helpful to set an alarm on their phone.
This document is used to test the chunking and retrieval capabilities of the system.
We want to verify that small chunks are created and that overlap works as expected.
End of test document.
